# CSS Grids Activity

## Description

For our lesson activity, I was required to re-create the design of a fictional online furniture store using CSS Grids to achieve a polished, professional-level layout. With the addition of `@media` queries I was able to make the grids responsive to various screen-sizes. 

## Learning Points

Learning about CSS Grids has been very useful and will help in future when building professional front pages for websites. 

The media queries will be especially useful when building responsive layouts and it was a great introduction into how you can change your layout dependant on screen-size.
